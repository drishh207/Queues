# Queues
 Queue and Circular queue implementations
 It contains:
 1. Normal queue implementation with resizing of array if full. But in normal queue, even when the space is left in the array, the queue       will be resized because of the position of rear.
 2. To overcome disadvantage of normal queue, circular queue is used and also have been implemented.
